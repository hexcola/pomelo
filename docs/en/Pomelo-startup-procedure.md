## Overview of startup procedure

The startup model diagram of Pomelo is as follow:

## Startup Entrance

The file app.js in game-server directory is the entrance of the project which you develop with pomelo. The startup code in app.js is as follow:

```javascript
var pomelo = require('pomelo');
var app = pomelo.createApp();
app.set('name', 'nameofproject');
app.defaultConfiguration();
app.start();
``` 

Firstly, it creates an application using pomelo; then it sets the application name. After that it makes default configuration of pomelo. These configurations are necessary environments to create a pomelo project, and finally you can start the application. When app.js is running, pomelo will start different components and servers according to the configurations of the application.

### Servers and components startup

After starting the application, it first loads components, including handler, filter, master, monitor, proxy, remote, server, sync, connection. Component is the bridge between pomelo and dependencies of pomelo, different servers load different components; developer can load different components based on different requirements of the application, furthermore, developers can customize their own components.

Component also has its life cycle, including before start, start, after start, stop etc. Developers can implement these methods in component and server launch corresponding methods at different life time of component.

Master server will first load master component, and master server is started by the master component. When the master component is started, it loads the adminConsole module. Then it starts all other servers according to user configuration file servers.json and parameters received by the master server. All servers start from app.js, load corresponding components, and launch at last.

## Detail of startup procedure

## Application initiation and startup
All servers are started from app.js. And each server creates an application object in its process after starting, and all server information is attached in this object, which includes server physical information, server logic information and pomelo components information. Moreover, this objects provide management and configuration methods of application. After invoking app.start() method in app.js, application object loads default components using loadDefaultComponents method.

## Load components
When loading components, different servers load different components according to the information of its server type. For example, the framework loads master component and monitor component for master server, and loads proxy, filter, handler and server components for other servers in default. It may load special component in certain server, for example, frontend servers load connection component, and backend servers load remote component, default components are described as follows:

* master: starting the master server.
* monitor: starting each server's monitor service, the service is in charge of collecting information of servers and regularly pushing messages to the master, maintaining the master server's heartbeat connection.
* proxy: generating server RPC client, which is essential for server processes comuniation(except master server).
* handler: loading handlers in front-end server.
* filter: loading filters for requests service, including filters before and after the calling of rpc.
* remote: loading the back-end servers, and generates rpc server.
* server: starting service of user requests handling in all servers.
* connector: starting session service in front-end servers and receiving user requests.
* sync: starting data synchronization service and provide external data synchronization service.
* connection: starting the service of user connection statistical data.
