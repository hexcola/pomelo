Introduction

pomelo-admin-web provides a way to monitoring status of the running pomelo server cluster via a web browser based on the monitoring and management framework provided by pomelo. Through pomelo-admin-web, you can make real-time monitoring on the running status, performance, logs, etc. for the pomelo server cluster. Here its depends on several admin-module shown as following:

If port conflict happening, you can modify config/admin.json to avoid it. The browser should support WebSocket, the latest Chrome is recommended. 

For script admin-module, the script executed is same as in [pomelo-cli](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo-cli), within which there is a [specification](Pomelo-cli-usage#wiki-spec) for how to write this kind script.
