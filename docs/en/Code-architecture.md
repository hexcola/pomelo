# lordofpomelo code organizations

The lordofpomelo code includes two parts, the back-end server code for the game-server and front-end code for the web-server. Game-server is the server side of lordofpomelo, including all the game logic code and game server code. Web-server is the client of lordofpomelo, including the web pages and user login and registration codes. In addition to these two parts, there is a shared directory used to store shared code and configuration.

As a distributed game server, lordofpomelo includes different instances of game servers, and these servers will use the same code. Different server instances will load their own code separately, according to the configuration files. The following figure is the code structure:
